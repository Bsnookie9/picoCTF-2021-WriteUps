# Hints

Using `ctrl` + `shift` + `i` to inspect the page, we can see there is another `.js` file under the "Sources" tab: `Y8splx37qY.js` 

This also has the same constant in the first line:

```js
const _0x6d8f = ['copy_char', 'value', '207aLjBod', '1301420SaUSqf', '233ZRpipt', '2224QffgXU', 'check_flag', '408533hsoVYx', 'instance', '278338GVFUrH', 'Correct!', '549933ZVjkwI', 'innerHTML', 'charCodeAt', './aD8SvhyVkb', 'result', '977AzKzwq', 'Incorrect!', 'exports', 'length', 'getElementById', '1jIrMBu', 'input', '615361geljRK'];
```

Looking through this similarly to the previous challenge, we will see the path `./aD8SvhyVkb`

Removing `index.html` from the path and replacing with the path above causes a file to download

Open this file and you get this:

At the very end of the file is what looks like the flag, but it is enconded. I wasn't sure at first what it was encoded with 
but after trial and error, I discovered it uses XOR Brute Force. I used [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to check this and found that it uses key 8:
