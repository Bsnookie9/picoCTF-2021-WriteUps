# Overview
`Easy` `Web Exploitation` `picoCTF 2021`

# Description
There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/. Can you find it?

# Hints
You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

# Solution
Using the link provided, we can see a simple webpage with some HTML. This challenge seems straightforward and by its name
sounds like we will need to inspect the page. Use `ctrl` + `shift` + `i`

In the 'index.html' file under the "Sources" tab we see a comment that gives us the first part of the flag:

```
<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->
```
In the 'mycss.css' file also under the "Sources" tab we see another comment that gives us the second part of the flag:

```
/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
```

In the 'myjs.js' file under the "Sources" tab we see yet another comment that hints us at the next part of the challenge:

```
/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
```

Using this hint we can deduce the next part of the flag will be in the robots.txt file of the webpage.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Robots.txt is a file that tells search-engine crawlers which pages can or can't be requested.

Heading to http://mercury.picoctf.net:27278/robots.txt we see:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /index.html
# Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
```

Using the apache server hint we try the '.htaccess' default apache file at http://mercury.picoctf.net:27278/.htaccess

```
# Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
```

After doing some research about default Mac files relating to Store, I found the ".DS_Store" file and get the last part of the flag from http://mercury.picoctf.net:27278/.DS_Store:

```
Congrats! You completed the scavenger hunt. Part 5: _a69684fd}
```

Piecing all those parts together, you get the flag!
